## JENY HOANG's PORTFOLIO PROJECT

Thank you for visiting my SQL portfolio project! This repository hosts an assortment of SQL queries and scripts I've created during my experience in data analysis and database management.


## Database Overview
1. FLIGHT ANALYTICS - [SQL](https://github.com/HoangJeny/SQL-Portfolio-Project/blob/main/FLIGHT%20ANALYTICS)
The flight database contains a rich dataset with detailed information about flights, customers, routes, and pricing. Key columns in the database include `Departure City`, `Arrival City`, `Departure Date`, `Flight Duration`, `Delay Minutes`, `Customer ID`, `Name`, `Booking Class`, `Frequent Flyer Status`, `Route`, `Ticket Price`, `Competitor Price`, `Demand`, `Origin`, `Destination`, and `Profitability`.
